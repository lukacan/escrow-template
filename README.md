# **Janecek Method**

## 🍇***Rules***:
- <u>Only owner can register party into the vote</u>
- <u>Every voter has 2 positive and 1 negative votes</u>
- <u>Negative vote can be given only after 2 positive</u>
- <u>One party can receive only 1 positive vote from the voter, no restriction for negative vote (can spent negative vote to party you voted positive)</u>
- <u>Voting ends 7 days after deployment</u>
- <u>Everyone can see estimated time to the end (in seconds)</u>
- <u>Everyone can vote and see vote results live, but you have to be registered as voter</u>

## 🍉***Owner***
- **Voting owner** = PDA derived from "voting_owner" and author`s public key.
## 🍊***Voting state***
- **Voting state** = PDA derived from "voting_state" and address of voting owner PDA.
- A **voting state** is an account created by the app during the start (multiple voting states can active simultaneously) and associated with the **voting owner**. Voters are allowed to vote for 1 week - the deadline is set in the voting state account.
- Thanks to **canonical property of find_program_address**, author can be tied up to only one voting_owner same as to only one voting state.
- Multiple voting owners with voting states can "live" simultaneously.
- **Author** is responsible for paying **fees**.

## 🍋***Voter***
- **Voter** = PDA derived from "new_voter", author`s public key and address of voting state PDA.
- This ensures that author cannot create multiple voters in specified voting state.
- **Author pais fees** for creating voter account. 
- No need for owner approval to become new Voter, one restriction is that you have to provide context in which you want to vote, so you can`t be voter without context.
- Voter in specified context can`t be created after voting ended.
## 🍍***Party***
- **Party** = PDA derived from its name and address of voting state PDA.
- That means party name has to be uniqe in context of one voting state
- **Author** is responsible for paing **fees**.
- **Author and Owner, who corresponds to this voting state, have to sign transaction - meaning owner has to approve inserting new party into context.**
- Party in specified context can`t be created after voting in the context ended.

## 🥥***Security checks***
- **Signer Checks** to verify that specific accounts have signed a transaction.✅
- Use **Owner Checks** to verify that accounts are owned by the expected program.✅
- Use **Data Validation** checks to verify that account data matches an expected value
- Use an **Account Discriminator** or **Initialization Flag** to check whether an account has already been initialized to prevent an account from being reinitialized and overriding existing account data.✅
- When an instruction requires two mutable accounts of the same type, an attacker can pass in the same account twice, causing the account to be mutated in unintended ways.
- Use **discriminators** to distinguish between different account types 
- Perform **program checks in native programs** by simply comparing the public key of the passed-in program to the progam you expected.✅
- Using **find_program_address** ensures that the highest valid bump, or canonical bump, is used for the derivation, thus creating a deterministic way to find an address given specific seeds.✅
- Using the same PDA for multiple authority domains opens your program up to the possibility of users accessing data and funds that don't belong to them
- Check writable accounts.
- Check rent exempt.
- Check bumps vs saved bumps.
- Double check correct program ID.
